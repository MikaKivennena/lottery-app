# lottery-app
App that calculates how long it will take for you to hit the jackpot in lottery. It basically shows you what a scam the lottery actually is.

This app is run in the command line. While starting the app, you can give seven numbers as arguments while starting and the app will take them in as your lottery numbers. 
If you don't give any arguments, the app will ask you for the numbers one by one.
There's different classes that are used in the main method of the app. 
Some of them are specific to this app and others are ready for use outside of this project. Even the ones made for this are able to be modified for other use as well.
